# Google-Hash-Code-2022
Our attempt for Google Hash Code 2022. The code is contained in JaKichuDiyeDe.java

# Classes
We used 4 nested Classes - Contributer, Project, Skill, ProjectExecution

# Algorithm
The algorithm uses a random heuristic to assign a cost to each unfinished project based on the current day. The projects then get assigned contributers greedily in descending order of their cost function.
